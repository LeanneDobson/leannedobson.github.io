# Personal Website

Hi I'm Leanne Dobson a UX / UI Designer based in Oxfordshire.

This is my personal website. It will eventually contain my recent work examples, blog posts, about and contact.
I'm also using this as an opportunity to learn grid and flexbox which is very exciting and makes life
so much easier. You can view some of my experiments into grid on CodePen here: https://codepen.io/leanne-dobson/

You can view the site here:
